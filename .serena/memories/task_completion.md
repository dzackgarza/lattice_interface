# Task Completion Checklist
- Determine assignment type first via `AGENTS.md`, then apply the corresponding playbook(s).
- For documentation assignments:
  - follow `prompt.md` and `docs/documentation_coverage_audit_playbook.md`;
  - review `docs/TODO.md` and execute relevant outstanding items;
  - if documentation files changed, commit assignment-owned changes.
- For code/test/runtime assignments:
  - follow `docs/test_coverage_playbook.md`;
  - run relevant tests (canonical: `just test`, or targeted Sage command) and report failures honestly.
- For interface-contract assignments:
  - follow `docs/interface_design_playbook.md`;
  - preserve mathematical/type-contract correctness over legacy compatibility.
- Always:
  - keep changes source-backed and mathematically explicit;
  - do not revert/reset unrelated dirty files;
  - do NOT write Serena memories that summarize what you did, what changed, or what remains — that is a changelog, not actionable insight; memories must contain only information a future agent needs to act on that it cannot discover from the files themselves.
