# Playbook Router

Use the playbook that matches the assignment type.

## Assignment Type Routing

- Documentation-only assignments:
  - `docs/documentation_coverage_audit_playbook.md`
- Code/test/runtime behavior assignments:
  - `docs/test_coverage_playbook.md`
- Interface-contract/type-surface design assignments:
  - `docs/interface_design_playbook.md`

When an assignment spans multiple types, apply the relevant playbooks together.
