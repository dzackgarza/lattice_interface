# GAP Forms Package Method Test Gap Checklist

Tracks GAP `Forms` package methods documented in `docs/forms/lattice/forms_lattice_reference.md`.

---

## 5. Invariant and Preserved Forms of Matrix Groups

- [ ] `InvariantBilinearForm(G[, involution][, isom])`
- [ ] `InvariantQuadraticForm(G[, involution][, isom])`
- [ ] `PreservedSesquilinearForms(G)`
  - Caveat: documented for absolutely irreducible groups.
- [ ] `PreservedQuadraticForms(G)`
  - Caveat: documented for absolutely irreducible groups over finite fields of odd characteristic.
- [ ] `PreservedForms(G)`

---

## 6. Orthogonal Decomposition and Witt Index

- [ ] `OrthogonalSubgroups(G, n[, s])`
- [ ] `OrthogonalSubgroupsAsList(G, n[, s])`
- [ ] `OrthogonalComponents(G, n)`
- [ ] `OrthogonalComponentsOfSubgroup(U, n)`
  - Caveat: requires subgroup `U` generated by vectors in a row-space model carrying form `n`.
- [ ] `WittIndex(form)`
  - Caveat: algorithm documented for finite fields; in characteristic `2`, method requires a non-singular form.
- [ ] `TypeOfForm(form)`
- [ ] `IsHyperbolicForm(form)`
- [ ] `IsEllipticForm(form)`
- [ ] `IsParabolicForm(form)`

---

## Domain and Constraint Caveats

- The `Forms` package is finite-field form algebra (`GF(q)`) and does not use real-signature positive-definite/indefinite regimes.
- Quadratic-form matrix extraction (`MatrixOfQuadraticForm`) is documented for odd characteristic.
- `PreservedQuadraticForms` is documented for absolutely irreducible matrix groups over odd-characteristic finite fields.
