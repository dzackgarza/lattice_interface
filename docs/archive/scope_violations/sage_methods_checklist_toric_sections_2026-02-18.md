# Archived Sage Checklist Sections (Out of Active Scope)

Archived from `docs/sage_methods_checklist.md` on 2026-02-18.

These sections are toric/fan/polytope surfaces and are out of active bilinear-form lattice scope for this project.

## Module: sage.geometry.toric_lattice / toric geometry

- [ ] `ToricLattice(n)`
- [ ] `dual()`
  - Caveat: toric N/M duality, not metric dual from Gram form.
- [ ] `Fan(..., lattice=...)`
  - Caveat: fan/cone machinery uses module structure and does not consume lattice inner-product matrices.
- [ ] `Cone(..., lattice=...)`
