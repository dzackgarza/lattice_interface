# Online Provenance: GAP toric package (2026-02-17 UTC)

## Scope

Source survey for first-class checklist/reference surfaces covering GAP `toric` methods.

## Canonical URLs used

- Package page:
  `https://gap-packages.github.io/toric/`
- Manual table of contents:
  `https://gap-packages.github.io/toric/doc/chap0_mj.html`

## Evidence extraction summary

- Confirmed `toric` as an active GAP package with dedicated documentation pages.
- Confirmed method-surface families tracked in the existing umbrella GAP lattice docs
  and lifted them into a package-specific checklist/reference surface:
  - cone membership and dual cone tests,
  - fan/face/cone combinatorics,
  - toric variety embedding and divisor-polytope workflows,
  - Euler/Betti/cardinality summary routines.

## Open triage items

- Retrieve per-chapter API pages and extract full typed argument signatures for
  `toric` methods currently represented as `(...)` runtime-name surfaces.
- Add `method:` tagged tests for representative methods before checklist completion
  states are advanced.
