# Archive Scope Policy

This archive stores documentation that is intentionally out of scope for this project's lattice-theory definition.

In-scope lattice theory for this repository is strictly:

- free `R`-modules of finite rank,
- equipped with a symmetric nondegenerate bilinear form,
- with methods that explicitly operate on that bilinear-form lattice structure.

Archived content under `docs/archive/scope_violations/` is retained for traceability and historical context, but it is not part of the active lattice-theory documentation target.

Examples of out-of-scope themes include:

- polyhedral/H-V representation tooling without explicit bilinear-form lattice APIs,
- generic LP/MIP tooling,
- toric/fan/polytope workflows without explicit bilinear-form lattice contracts,
- counting/enumeration pipelines not centered on symmetric nondegenerate bilinear-form lattices.
