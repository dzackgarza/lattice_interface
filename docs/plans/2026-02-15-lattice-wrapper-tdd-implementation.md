# Lattice Wrapper TDD Test Program Implementation Plan

> **For Claude:** REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: Use superpowers:executing-plans to implement this plan task-by-task.

**Goal:** Define a backend-agnostic, mathematically honest, strongly typed lattice wrapper test contract that standardizes capabilities and recovers the full known Sage+Julia documented lattice functionality at equal-or-better coverage.

**Architecture:** Build a capability-first test architecture. First define typed wrapper surfaces (including strict definite/indefinite split), then map legacy documented functionality into canonical capabilities, then enforce parity and quality with hard failing gates. Use strict TDD for each capability family (red-green-refactor).

**Tech Stack:** `pytest`, Sage (`conda -n sage`), Julia/Oscar test catalogs, Python static/parity tooling, repository test quality rules (`TEST_QUALITY.md` + AGENTS playbook).

---

## Approach Options
1. Capability Registry + Parity Matrix (Recommended)  
Tradeoff: highest upfront taxonomy effort; best long-term standardization and hard coverage guarantees.
2. Scenario Corpus Only  
Tradeoff: easier startup; weaker traceability and easier to miss surface drift.
3. Method Name Parity  
Tradeoff: fastest initially; violates requirement because backend method names are explicitly irrelevant.

Chosen: `1`.
