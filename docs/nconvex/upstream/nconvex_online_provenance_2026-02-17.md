# GAP NConvex Online Provenance Snapshot (2026-02-17)

Date accessed (UTC): 2026-02-17
Auditor: Codex
Scope: establish first-class checklist/reference surface for GAP `NConvex` and record method-level source-access blockers.

---

## Surveyed sources

- GAP package page:
  - `https://gap-packages.github.io/NConvex/`
- NConvex repository:
  - `https://github.com/homalg-project/NConvex`

---

## Evidence captured in this pass

- `NConvex` package existence and package-ecosystem status were confirmed.
- Package-level role was confirmed as polyhedral geometry tooling in the homalg/GAP ecosystem.
- Repository endpoint was confirmed for future source/manual extraction.

---

## Unresolved method-surface blocker

- Canonical method-index/manual chapter pages for `NConvex` were not retrievable from available web endpoints in this environment during this pass.
- Because method signatures could not be verified from canonical docs, no method-level claims were added.

---

## Required follow-up

- Retrieve canonical manual/source method pages for `NConvex`.
- Expand `docs/nconvex_methods_checklist.md` and `docs/nconvex/lattice/nconvex_lattice_reference.md` with exact method names, argument contracts, and constraints.
