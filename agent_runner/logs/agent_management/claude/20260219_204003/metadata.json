  "last_message": "Doc_coverage agents repeatedly edited `agents/` files despite a nominal prohibition because the prior constraint was conditional (\"when no documentation gap is obvious\"), giving agents a rationalization path whenever they perceived a management gap; the fix replaces this with an absolute scope boundary (\"your edits are limited to `docs/`\u2014never modify files under `agents/`\"), removing the conditional entirely. Separately, the management agent prompt incorrectly directed agents to find playbooks at `docs/*_playbook.md` (they are at `agents/*/playbook.md`), a factual error that could cause management agents to fail to locate the files they need to audit. Both changes were committed.",
