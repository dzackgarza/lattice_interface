last_message: The GAP Forms Package reference lacked explicit type specifications for arguments and return values, making it difficult to use without consulting upstream GAP documentation. I added argument types and return types to all function tables across sections 2-6, including constructors, predicates, attributes, equivalence methods, and orthogonal decomposition functions, sourced from GAP Forms manual chapters 4 and 5. The GAP Forms type specification task is now marked complete in TODO.md, advancing Goal 2 (contract fidelity) for this package.
