last_message: The "missing Sources sections" items in the TODO were marked as complete but the underlying issue was a false positive - both `docs/sage/lattice/sagemath_lattice_reference.md` (section 19) and `docs/gap/lattice/gap_lattice_methods_reference.md` (section 5) already had Sources sections. The actual gap was in the crystallographic_stack reference, which lacked a Sources section entirely - I added one with proper source references. Goal 2 is now verified as complete for all in-scope bilinear-form lattice reference docs.
