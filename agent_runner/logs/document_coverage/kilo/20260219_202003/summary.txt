last_message: I found and fixed a contract gap in the PARI/GP reference documentation. The `qfcholesky` function was incorrectly tagged as `[PD]` (positive-definite) in the reference doc, but the upstream PARI documentation only states "Given a square symmetric matrix M" without explicitly requiring positive-definiteness. This differs from other PARI functions like `qfisom`, `qfauto`, `qfisominit`, and `qfcvp` which explicitly state "positive definite quadratic form" in their documentation. I removed the unsupported `[PD]` tag and clarified that Cholesky decomposition mathematically succeeds only for positive (semi)definite matrices, added a source citation, and committed the fix.
