last_message: The `is_positive_definite(L)`, `is_negative_definite(L)`, and `is_definite(L)` methods on Julia's `ZZLat` type in the Oscar.jl documentation previously had empty Description fields, making their mathematical semantics unclear. Added precise descriptions: "All eigenvalues > 0", "All eigenvalues < 0", and "Positive or negative definite (not indefinite or degenerate)" respectively, which matches the semantic meaning of these predicates in lattice theory. This ensures method coverage requirements are met with proper mathematical specifications.
