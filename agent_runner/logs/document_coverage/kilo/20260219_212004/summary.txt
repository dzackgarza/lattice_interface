last_message: The `qfperfection` function in the PARI/GP reference doc was missing the `[PD]` tag required for positive-definite forms. The upstream documentation explicitly states it operates on "positive definite quadratic form" (lines 2595-2598 of the local snapshot), yet the reference only noted the rank-8 limitation without tagging the definiteness constraint. This created an inconsistency with other PARI functions like `qfisom`, `qfauto`, and `qfisominit` that properly document their PD requirements. The fix adds the `[PD]` tag and explicit constraint language, sourced from the local upstream docs.
