last_message: The documentation for in-scope bilinear-form lattice methods is complete and correct. All reference files have source-backed signatures with typed arguments, return types, and domain constraints (definiteness tags like [PD], [INDEF], [ND]). The documentation coverage has been verified for all major ecosystems (Sage, GAP, PARI/GP, Julia/OSCAR, fpylll, NTL, FLINT, flatter, g6k) and includes local upstream provenance snapshots. This matters because users need mathematically precise, source-attested API contracts to reliably use lattice-theory methods in the strict sense required by this project.
