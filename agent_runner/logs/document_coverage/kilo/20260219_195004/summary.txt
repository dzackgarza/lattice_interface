last_message: The missing `discriminant()` method on `IntegralLattice` was undocumented in the reference file despite being a distinct contract from its parent class `FreeQuadraticModule_generic`. The parent applies a (−1)^r sign factor, while IntegralLattice's override returns plain det(gram_matrix()) — a semantic difference already noted in the broader reference but missing from the specific IntegralLattice method table. This has now been added with explicit notation of the semantic distinction.
