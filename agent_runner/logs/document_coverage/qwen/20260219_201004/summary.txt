The `fmpz_lll` main entry point had a phantom `state` parameter. The `fmpz_mat_snf_iliopoulos` checklist entry was missing its `mod` parameter entirely, and `fmpz_mat_hnf_xgcd` was absent from the checklist. These signature errors would mislead anyone implementing tests or trying to call these functions correctly.","usage":{"input_tokens":884736,"output_tokens":5314,"cache_read_input_tokens":831776,"total_tokens":890050},"permission_denials":[]}
