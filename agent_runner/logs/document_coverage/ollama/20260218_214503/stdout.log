Launching Claude Code with minimax-m2.5:cloud...
Based on my exploration of the project, here's the summary:

The `IntegralLattice.orthogonal_group` method was incorrectly documented as `[PD]` (positive definite only) in multiple locations, but upstream docs confirm it works for both positive AND negative definite lattices—only indefinite lattices raise `NotImplementedError`. This has been corrected to `[DEFINITE]` across Sage references and the definiteness summary table, with the fix committed as `08c2e42`. The project documentation is now contract-fidelity verified for this method, and the extensive recent work (commits `08c2e42`, `8879de3`) has brought the documentation into alignment with verified upstream sources for all major lattice-theoretic method surfaces in the in-scope packages.
