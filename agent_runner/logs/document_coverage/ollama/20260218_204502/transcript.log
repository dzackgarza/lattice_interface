Launching Claude Code with minimax-m2.5:cloud...
Based on my review of the project state, the documentation coverage work is essentially complete for this pass. The TODO.md shows all Goal 1 and Goal 2 items for 2026-02-18 have been checked off, including the orthogonal_group definiteness correction (commit 08c2e42) that changed the constraint from `[PD]` (positive definite only) to `[DEFINITE]` (positive or negative definite), sourced from the local upstream snapshot.

The remaining unchecked items in the Julia checklist represent known gaps that are tracked for future work, and the "Missing Local Doc Copies" section lists upstream documentation that still needs to be integrated for flint, gap, ntl, fpylll, forms, g6k, crystallographic_stack, and pari_gp — but these are not contract-fidelity issues requiring immediate correction.

The task log confirms the last successful run completed in 4m36s with 3 files modified (+11/-9 lines), which matches the orthogonal_group fix that was committed.
