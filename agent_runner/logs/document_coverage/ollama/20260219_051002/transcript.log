Launching Claude Code with minimax-m2.5:cloud...
I've reviewed the project state and understand the context. This is a continuation of existing type specification work that's already defined in the TODO.md, not a new feature requiring design.

The task is clear from the handoff memory and TODO.md:
- **Remaining SageMath sections**: QuadraticForm (5), BinaryQF (6), TernaryQF (7), TorsionQuadraticModule (8), Genus (9), Matrix methods (10), Helper functions (11)
- **Remaining Julia/Hecke.jl sections**: Vector enumeration, Genus, TorQuadModule, ZZLatWithIsom

This is straightforward documentation expansion on existing surfaces. The brainstorming skill is designed for creating new features with design approval - but this work is already scoped in the TODO.md from previous sessions.

Should I proceed with adding type specifications to the remaining SageMath sections (QuadraticForm, BinaryQF, TernaryQF, TorsionQuadraticModule, Genus), or would you prefer something different?
