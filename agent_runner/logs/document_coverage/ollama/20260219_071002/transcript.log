Launching Claude Code with minimax-m2.5:cloud...
Based on my cursory maintenance check, both Goals 1 and 2 are already complete: no missing in-scope bilinear-form lattice package surfaces were identified, and all reference documentation sections (SageMath, Julia/Hecke.jl, GAP Forms) now have explicit type specifications with Argument Types and Return Type columns. The TODO.md reflects this completion status. This matters because mathematical precision in contract documentation ensures users can correctly implement lattice-theoretic workflows across ecosystems without silent type mismatches or incorrect assumptions.
