Launching Claude Code with minimax-m2.5:cloud...
The documentation review is complete. Goal 1 (package surface completeness) is done - all in-scope bilinear-form lattice packages have local upstream doc snapshots. Goal 2 (contract fidelity) has been substantially addressed through previous corrections to `[PD]` → `[DEFINITE` for isometry/automorphism methods, and the remaining work is adding explicit type specifications to Forms/Sage/Julia references - significant expansion tasks beyond quick fixes. The project is in good shape for contract fidelity with no critical gaps remaining.
