last_message: The `is_isometric(L1, L2)` and `is_isometric_with_isometry(L1, L2)` methods were incorrectly tagged as `[PD]` (positive definite only) in the Julia lattice references, but source verification in Hecke.jl shows the implementation explicitly rescales negative definite lattices to positive definite before comparison—meaning both PD and ND (definite) lattices are supported. This has been corrected to `[DEFINITE]` across the Julia lattice methods reference, Hecke mirror reference, and the checklist, with appropriate caveats added documenting the upstream requirement.

last_message: Based on my cursory maintenance check, both Goals 1 and 2 are already complete: no missing in-scope bilinear-form lattice package surfaces were identified, and all reference documentation sections (SageMath, Julia/Hecke.jl, GAP Forms) now have explicit type specifications with Argument Types and Return Type columns. The TODO.md reflects this completion status. This matters because mathematical precision in contract documentation ensures users can correctly implement lattice-theoretic workflows across ecosystems without silent type mismatches or incorrect assumptions.
