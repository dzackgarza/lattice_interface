Launching Claude Code with minimax-m2.5:cloud...
Based on my thorough review of the documentation state:

**Summary of Findings:**

1. **Goal 1 (Package Surface Completeness)**: COMPLETE - All in-scope bilinear-form lattice packages have verified local upstream docs and checklist surfaces. No new package gaps were identified.

2. **Goal 2 (Contract Fidelity)**: The major contract fidelity corrections are complete:
   - Julia/OSCAR `is_isometric` / `is_isometric_with_isometry`: [PD] → [DEFINITE] (commit fc23d1b)
   - Julia/OSCAR `automorphism_group_generators` / `automorphism_group_order`: [PD] → [DEFINITE] 
   - Sage `IntegralLattice.orthogonal_group`: [PD] → [DEFINITE]
   - GAP `NormalFormIntMat` / `Decomposition`: Placeholder signatures replaced with actual signatures
   - FLINT/NTL integration corrections completed (commit f2e3e13)

The remaining [PD] tags in the docs (e.g., `minimum`, `kissing_number`, `short_vectors`, `theta_series`, `voronoi_cell`) are mathematically correct - these operations genuinely require positive definiteness.

The remaining items in TODO.md (explicit type specifications for GAP Forms, SageMath, and Julia/Hecke) are described in the handoff as "substantial expansion tasks requiring method-by-method review" that should be triaged to future passes rather than attempted in a single session.

**The project documentation is in good shape.** The core contract fidelity work is complete, and the remaining type specification work is a separate expansion effort that has been properly triaged.
