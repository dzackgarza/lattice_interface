Launching Claude Code with minimax-m2.5:cloud...
Based on the current state of the repository:

**Status Summary:**
- **Goal 1 (package surface completeness)**: ✅ Complete - no new in-scope bilinear-form lattice packages need checklists
- **Goal 2 (contract fidelity)**: ✅ Complete - all contract-fidelity items from the 2026-02-18 pass are checked off in `docs/TODO.md`

The last commit (`08c2e42`) corrected the `IntegralLattice.orthogonal_group` definiteness constraint from `[PD]` to `[DEFINITE]`, sourced from the local upstream snapshot demonstrating that negative definite lattices work while only indefinite lattices raise `NotImplementedError`.

The remaining items in TODO.md are minor maintenance items (integration checks for partial local doc copies: flint, ntl, fpylll, forms, g6k, crystallographic_stack, pari_gp) - these are not part of the mandatory Goals 1 and 2, which are both satisfied.

The documentation coverage work for the current phase is complete. All mandatory contract-fidelity corrections have been applied, verified against source documents, and committed.
