last_message: GAP core section 1.1 was missing the standard 5-column type-specification format that sections 1.2 and 1.3 already had; all 20 integer-matrix normal-form functions (`NullspaceIntMat`, `SolutionIntMat`, `HNF`/`SNF` variants, `NormalFormIntMat`, `ComplementIntMat`, `Decomposition`, etc.) lacked explicit argument types and return types. This is now corrected with types sourced directly from `matint.gd` and `chap25.html`, bringing the section into compliance with the project's contract-fidelity standard and ensuring callers can determine without consulting upstream what each function accepts and returns.
