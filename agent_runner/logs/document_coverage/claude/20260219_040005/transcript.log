The FLINT reference had five incorrect or incomplete signatures that were found by verifying the local upstream `.rst` files against the reference: the eta parameter interval was documented as closed at 0.5 when it is actually open, the `hnf_pernet_stein` and `snf_iliopoulos` entries were both missing required parameters (`state` and `mod` respectively), `hnf_modular_eldiv` was wrongly described as taking a separate output matrix when it operates in-place, and `hnf_xgcd` was entirely absent. The NTL reference had `LatticeSolve` returning "the image determinant" when it actually returns 1 or 0, `LLL_plus` with the wrong first-parameter type (`ZZ&` instead of `vec_ZZ&`), and was missing all rational-delta LLL overloads. All eight errors are now corrected from local upstream sources, TODO.md marks Goal 1 complete for all packages, and Goal 2 work on type annotations for Forms/SageMath/Julia remains the next priority.
