last_message: Three contract errors were present in the Julia lattice references and are now corrected: `short_vectors` and `shortest_vectors` in the main Oscar/Hecke reference lacked the `elem_type` and `check` parameters confirmed by upstream (the missing `check` parameter is especially significant because it defaults to `true` and governs whether definiteness is validated before enumeration, so callers relying on the old signature would not know the function silently accepts an `even=false` default and can raise errors on indefinite input). The `integer_genera` entry used a placeholder `...` rather than naming its keyword arguments `min_scale`, `max_scale`, and `even`, and the secondary Hecke reference additionally documented the default of `even` as `true` when upstream confirms it is `false`. This matters because a caller trusting the old documentation would assume odd-lattice enumeration is off by default, when in fact both even and odd lattices are included unless `even=true` is explicitly passed.
