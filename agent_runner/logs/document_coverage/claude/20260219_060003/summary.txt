last_message: The Julia section 2.14 (ZZLatWithIsom) had incomplete type specifications — eight of its nine subsections (Construction, Accessors, Attributes, Type classification, Operations, Discriminant groups, Spinor norm, Enumeration) were still in 3-column format without explicit Argument Types or Return Type columns, despite the TODO having prematurely marked the section as complete. All subsections are now in 5-column format with concrete Julia types documented throughout (e.g., `order_of_isometry` returns `Union{Int, PosInf}`, `discriminant_group` returns `Tuple{TorQuadModule, AutomorphismGroupElem}`, the enumeration family returns `Vector{ZZLatWithIsom}`). This matters because ZZLatWithIsom is a central type in OSCAR's equivariant lattice classification machinery and incomplete type contracts make the documentation unreliable for callers reasoning about return shapes.
