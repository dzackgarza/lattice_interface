  "last_message": "The `TorsionQuadraticModule` and `Genus` sections in sagemath_lattice_reference.md had no explicit argument types or return types in any of their method tables \u2014 only descriptions \u2014 making them harder to use precisely without consulting the original Sage source. These sections are particularly critical because the discriminant group and genus are central lattice-theory constructs that sit at the heart of the project's in-scope surface. The same gap existed in BinaryQF and TernaryQF. All four sections now carry full Argument Types and Return Type columns across every subsection, including subtleties like `is_genus(sig, even=True)` returning `bool` with the `even=False` branch noted as incomplete, `brown_invariant()` returning `IntegerMod(8)`, `representatives()` returning `list<IntegralLattice>` restricted to `[PD]`, and `gram_matrix_bilinear()` returning `Matrix<Rational>` (values in \u211a/m\u2124) rather than an integer matrix. This matters because type ambiguity in discriminant-form and genus methods is a common source of contract errors when documenting bilinear-form lattice workflows.",
