last_message: The `TorsionQuadraticModule` and `Genus` sections in sagemath_lattice_reference.md had no explicit argument types or return types in any of their method tables — only descriptions — making them harder to use precisely without consulting the original Sage source. These sections are particularly critical because the discriminant group and genus are central lattice-theory constructs that sit at the heart of the project's in-scope surface. The same gap existed in BinaryQF and TernaryQF. All four sections now carry full Argument Types and Return Type columns across every subsection, including subtleties like `is_genus(sig, even=True)` returning `bool` with the `even=False` branch noted as incomplete, `brown_invariant()` returning `IntegerMod(8)`, `representatives()` returning `list<IntegralLattice>` restricted to `[PD]`, and `gram_matrix_bilinear()` returning `Matrix<Rational>` (values in ℚ/mℤ) rather than an integer matrix. This matters because type ambiguity in discriminant-form and genus methods is a common source of contract errors when documenting bilinear-form lattice workflows.
