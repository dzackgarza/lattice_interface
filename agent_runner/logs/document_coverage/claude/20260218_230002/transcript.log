`automorphism_group_generators` and `automorphism_group_order` were incorrectly tagged `[PD]` (positive definite only) across the Julia umbrella reference, Hecke mirror reference, and methods checklist, but upstream OSCAR/Hecke docs explicitly say "Given a **definite** lattice" — meaning negative definite lattices are fully supported and only indefinite forms are excluded. This is now corrected to `[DEFINITE]` in all three surfaces, and the previously undocumented `ambient_representation::Bool=true` keyword argument has been added to `automorphism_group_generators`. This matters because mislabeling ND lattices as unsupported would cause users to unnecessarily rescale lattices or incorrectly expect errors on valid inputs — the same class of error previously found in Sage's `orthogonal_group`, confirming a recurring `[PD]` vs `[DEFINITE]` pattern that warrants targeted review of other `[PD]`-tagged methods.
