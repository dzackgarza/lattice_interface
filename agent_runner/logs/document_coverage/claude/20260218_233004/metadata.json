  "last_message": "The GAP core reference had two `(...)` placeholder signatures for `NormalFormIntMat` and `Decomposition` \u2014 opaque stubs with no argument types, return shapes, or constraint information. Both are now documented with source-backed contracts: `NormalFormIntMat(mat, options)` specifies the integer-bitmask control surface (SNF vs. HNF, off-diagonal reduction, unimodular transform inclusion, destructive mode) and the full record-return shape (`normal`, `rowtrans`/`coltrans`, `signdet`, `rank`); `Decomposition(A, B, depth)` specifies the cyclotomic-matrix rank constraint, the `\"nonnegative\"` depth variant with its first-column positivity precondition, and the per-entry `fail` return semantics. These fixes matter because `NormalFormIntMat` is the primary unified entry point for HNF/SNF computation in GAP and the bitmask interface is non-obvious \u2014 a missing or wrong options description would cause silent incorrect-form selection.",
