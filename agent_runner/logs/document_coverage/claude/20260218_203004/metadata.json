  "last_message": "The `IntegralLattice.orthogonal_group` method was documented with a `[PD]` (positive definite only) constraint in three locations across two Sage reference files, but upstream source docs confirm that negative definite lattices also succeed \u2014 only indefinite lattices raise `NotImplementedError`. This has been corrected to `[DEFINITE]` throughout, with matching caveat text and definiteness summary tables updated accordingly, sourced from the local upstream snapshot `free_quadratic_module_integer_symmetric.html`. The correct constraint matters because users with negative definite lattices (common in number-theory contexts, e.g. `E8(-1)` in K3 surface calculations) would incorrectly believe `orthogonal_group()` was unavailable to them.",
