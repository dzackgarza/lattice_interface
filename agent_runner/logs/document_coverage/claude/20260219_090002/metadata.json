  "last_message": "The documentation for `QuadraticForm.genera`, `find_p_neighbor_from_vec`, and `neighbor_iteration` in the SageMath quadratic form reference contained incomplete or incorrect argument signatures. `neighbor_iteration` had the most serious error: its first argument was documented as `p` (a prime), but the actual first argument is `seeds` (a list of quadratic forms to start iteration from). All three entries now carry source-backed complete signatures with explicit keyword argument types and defaults, verified against the local upstream snapshot at `docs/sage/quadratic_form/upstream/quadratic_form.html`. This matters because incorrect argument order (especially for `neighbor_iteration`) would cause silent failures in downstream code relying on the documentation.",
