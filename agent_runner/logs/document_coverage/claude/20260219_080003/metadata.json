  "last_message": "Two substantive contract gaps were present despite the previous session claiming Goal 2 complete: the GAP core reference's LLL reduction section used a completely uninformative `LLLReducedBasis(...)` placeholder with no argument or return documentation, and the SageMath `local_representation_conditions` method had wrong argument types (`\u2014`), a wrong return class name (`RepresentationConditions` instead of `LocalRepresentationConditions`), and was missing its critical correctness constraint (\u22653 variables required). Both are now corrected with source-backed contracts from `docs/gap/upstream/chap25.html` and `docs/sage/quadratic_form/upstream/quadratic_form.html` respectively, and committed. These gaps matter because the GAP LLL function is a core lattice operation and the SageMath constraint omission would cause silent incorrect results for forms in fewer than 3 variables.",
