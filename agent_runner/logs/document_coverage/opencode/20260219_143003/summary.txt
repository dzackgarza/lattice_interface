last_message: Three PARI/GP quadratic form functions were missing from the lattice reference documentation: `qfcholesky` (Cholesky decomposition for symmetric matrices), `qfjacobi` (Jacobi eigenvalue method for symmetric real matrices), and `qfbil` (obsolete bilinear form evaluation superseded by `qfeval`). These have been added to the reference documentation and methods checklist with proper source backing from PARI upstream docs, including definiteness constraints and obsolete status. Commit aef7719.
