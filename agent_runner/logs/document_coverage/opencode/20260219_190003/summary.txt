last_message: The `docs/latticegen/upstream/` directory was missing with no local provenance for the fplll latticegen CLI. Created upstream snapshot with source-backed signatures, added semantic details from the README (matrix structure for each generator method, selector constraints), and documented global flags `--help`/`--version`. The Python moire-lattice-generator package was incorrectly documented as a "lattice" surface; marked it out of scope since it provides image-processing APIs, not bilinear-form lattice-theoretic methods.
