last_message: The documentation coverage audit is now complete. Both mandatory goals have been verified: Goal 1 (package surface maintenance) is complete—no new bilinear-form lattice packages are missing—and Goal 2 (contract fidelity) is complete, with all reference doc sections now using explicit 5-column format with Argument Types and Return Type columns, plus major `[PD]` → `[DEFINITE]` corrections for `automorphism_group_generators`, `automorphism_group_order`, `is_isometric`, and `orthogonal_group`. This matters because incorrect `[PD]` tags would cause users with negative definite lattices (common in number-theory contexts) to unnecessarily avoid valid methods, and missing type specifications make the lattice-method APIs harder to use correctly without consulting upstream sources.
