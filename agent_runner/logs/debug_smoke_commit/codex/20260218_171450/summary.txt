last_message: Completed the smoke steps with one caveat on network access:

1. Created `tmp/agent_runner_debug/smoke.txt` with content `smoke ok`.
2. Added and committed that file only:
   - Commit: `b08d0bf`
   - Message: `agent_runner debug smoke`
3. Ran `curl -fsSL https://example.com >/dev/null` twice; both failed with:
   - `curl: (6) Could not resolve host: example.com`

So write + commit worked, but outbound DNS/network resolution is blocked in this environment.
