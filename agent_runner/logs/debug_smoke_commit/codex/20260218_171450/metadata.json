Added and committed that file only:\n   - Commit: `b08d0bf`\n   - Message: `agent_runner debug smoke`\n3. Ran `curl -fsSL https://example.com >/dev/null` twice; both failed with:\n   - `curl: (6) Could not resolve host: example.com`\n\nSo write + commit worked, but outbound DNS/network resolution is blocked in this environment.",
