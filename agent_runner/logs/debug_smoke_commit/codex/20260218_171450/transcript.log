Completed the smoke steps with one caveat on network access:

1. Created `tmp/agent_runner_debug/smoke.txt` with content `smoke ok`.
2. Added and committed that file only:
   - Commit: `b08d0bf`
   - Message: `agent_runner debug smoke`
3. Ran `curl -fsSL https://example.com >/dev/null` twice; both failed with:
   - `curl: (6) Could not resolve host: example.com`

So write + commit worked, but outbound DNS/network resolution is blocked in this environment.

# Debug Commit + Network Smoke Test

You are running in a repo. Do the minimum steps to prove you can write, commit, and access the network.

Steps:
1) Create a new file at `tmp/agent_runner_debug/smoke.txt` with a single line: `smoke ok`.
2) Git add and commit the file with message: `agent_runner debug smoke`.
3) Make a network call: `curl -fsSL https://example.com >/dev/null`.
4) Respond with a short summary of what you did.

**Planning playbook inspection**
codex
I’ll run this as a minimal runtime task: first I’m checking the required playbook instructions, then I’ll create the smoke file, commit only that file, and run the `curl` smoke check.
exec
/bin/bash -lc 'cat docs/test_coverage_playbook.md' in /home/dzack/lattice_interface succeeded in 50ms:
# Test Coverage Playbook

## Scope

Applies only when the assignment changes code, tests, or runtime behavior.

Does not apply to documentation-only assignments.

## Goal

- Keep reference-doc tests mathematically meaningful, explicit, and honest.
- Coverage reflects real tested behavior, not aliases or hidden exclusions.

## Environment

- Run Sage tests in the Sage conda env.
- Canonical command: `just test` (invokes `conda run -n sage ...`).
- Targeted command: `HOME=/tmp/sage-home conda run -n sage python -m pytest -q <path_or_test>`

## Rules

thinking
**Creating and committing file with curl**
codex
I’ve confirmed the playbook constraints; next I’m performing the three requested smoke steps in order and capturing the command results.
exec
/bin/bash -lc "mkdir -p tmp/agent_runner_debug && printf 'smoke ok\\n' > tmp/agent_runner_debug/smoke.txt && git add tmp/agent_runner_debug/smoke.txt && git commit -m 'agent_runner debug smoke' -- tmp/agent_runner_debug/smoke.txt && curl -fsSL https://example.com >/dev/null" in /home/dzack/lattice_interface exited 1 in 51ms:
The following paths are ignored by one of your .gitignore files:
tmp/agent_runner_debug
hint: Use -f if you really want to add them.
hint: Turn this message off by running
hint: "git config advice.addIgnoredFile false"

thinking
**Forcing git add for ignored files**
codex
`tmp/` is git-ignored here, so I’m force-adding only the requested file and then re-running commit plus network smoke call.
exec
/bin/bash -lc "git add -f tmp/agent_runner_debug/smoke.txt && git commit -m 'agent_runner debug smoke' -- tmp/agent_runner_debug/smoke.txt && curl -fsSL https://example.com >/dev/null" in /home/dzack/lattice_interface exited 6 in 51ms:
[main b08d0bf] agent_runner debug smoke
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
 create mode 100644 tmp/agent_runner_debug/smoke.txt
curl: (6) Could not resolve host: example.com

thinking
**Retrying network call despite DNS failure**
codex
The commit succeeded; network lookup failed on DNS resolution. I’m retrying the exact `curl` command once to confirm whether it’s an environment-level block.
exec
/bin/bash -lc 'curl -fsSL https://example.com >/dev/null' in /home/dzack/lattice_interface exited 6 in 51ms:
curl: (6) Could not resolve host: example.com
