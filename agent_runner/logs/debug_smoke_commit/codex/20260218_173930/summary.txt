last_message: Completed with one caveat on network:

1. Wrote `tmp/agent_runner_debug/smoke.txt` with a single line `smoke ok`.
2. Staged and committed it (forced add because `tmp/` is gitignored) with message `agent_runner debug smoke`.
   - Commit: `2ad514f`
3. Ran the requested network command: `curl -fsSL https://example.com >/dev/null`
   - It failed in this environment: `curl: (6) Could not resolve host: example.com` (and direct-resolve retry also failed to connect).
