last_message: Completed the smoke steps with one caveat on network access:

1. Created `tmp/agent_runner_debug/smoke.txt` with content `smoke ok`.
2. Added and committed that file only:
   - Commit: `b08d0bf`
   - Message: `agent_runner debug smoke`
3. Ran `curl -fsSL https://example.com >/dev/null` twice; both failed with:
   - `curl: (6) Could not resolve host: example.com`

So write + commit worked, but outbound DNS/network resolution is blocked in this environment.

last_message: Completed with one caveat on network:

1. Wrote `tmp/agent_runner_debug/smoke.txt` with a single line `smoke ok`.
2. Staged and committed it (forced add because `tmp/` is gitignored) with message `agent_runner debug smoke`.
   - Commit: `2ad514f`
3. Ran the requested network command: `curl -fsSL https://example.com >/dev/null`
   - It failed in this environment: `curl: (6) Could not resolve host: example.com` (and direct-resolve retry also failed to connect).

last_message: Completed the smoke test steps with one repo-specific adjustment:

1. Created `tmp/agent_runner_debug/smoke.txt` with:
   - `smoke ok`
2. Staged and committed it as `agent_runner debug smoke`:
   - Commit: `708bae2`
   - Note: `tmp/` is gitignored, so I used `git add -f tmp/agent_runner_debug/smoke.txt`.
3. Ran the network command exactly:
   - `curl -fsSL https://example.com >/dev/null`
   - Result: failed with `curl: (6) Could not resolve host: example.com` (DNS/network unavailable in this environment).
