Completed the requested steps with one environment limitation:

1. Created `tmp/agent_runner_debug/smoke.txt` containing exactly `smoke ok`.
2. Added and committed it as `agent_runner debug smoke` in commit `6e49fac` (used `git add -f` because `tmp/` is gitignored).
3. Ran `curl -fsSL https://example.com >/dev/null`, but it failed in this environment with: `Could not resolve host: example.com` (DNS/network access restricted).

# Debug Commit + Network Smoke Test

You are running in a repo. Do the minimum steps to prove you can write, commit, and access the network.

Steps:
1) Create a new file at `tmp/agent_runner_debug/smoke.txt` with a single line: `smoke ok`.
2) Git add and commit the file with message: `agent_runner debug smoke`.
3) Make a network call: `curl -fsSL https://example.com >/dev/null`.
4) Respond with a short summary of what you did.

**Planning minimal commit flow**
codex
I’m going to do exactly the four steps in order: create the smoke file, commit just that file, run the `curl` network check, then report the results. I’ll run the commands now.
exec
/bin/bash -lc "set -e
mkdir -p tmp/agent_runner_debug
printf 'smoke ok
' > tmp/agent_runner_debug/smoke.txt
git add tmp/agent_runner_debug/smoke.txt
git commit -m 'agent_runner debug smoke'
curl -fsSL https://example.com >/dev/null" in /home/dzack/lattice_interface exited 1 in 51ms:
The following paths are ignored by one of your .gitignore files:
tmp/agent_runner_debug
hint: Use -f if you really want to add them.
hint: Turn this message off by running
hint: "git config advice.addIgnoredFile false"

thinking
**Planning forced add workaround**
codex
`git add` failed because `tmp/` is ignored in this repo. I’m forcing add for that one file and continuing with commit + curl.
exec
/bin/bash -lc "set -e
git add -f tmp/agent_runner_debug/smoke.txt
git commit -m 'agent_runner debug smoke'
curl -fsSL https://example.com >/dev/null" in /home/dzack/lattice_interface exited 6 in 51ms:
[main 6e49fac] agent_runner debug smoke
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+), 1 deletion(-)
curl: (6) Could not resolve host: example.com
