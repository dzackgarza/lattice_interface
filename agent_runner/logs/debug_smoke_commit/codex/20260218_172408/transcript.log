Completed the smoke steps with one constraint:

1. Wrote `tmp/agent_runner_debug/smoke.txt` with `smoke ok`.
2. Added and committed it as `agent_runner debug smoke` (commit `0a53153`).
3. Ran `curl -fsSL https://example.com >/dev/null` (retried once), but it failed both times with `Could not resolve host: example.com` (DNS/network unavailable in this environment).

# Debug Commit + Network Smoke Test

You are running in a repo. Do the minimum steps to prove you can write, commit, and access the network.

Steps:
1) Create a new file at `tmp/agent_runner_debug/smoke.txt` with a single line: `smoke ok`.
2) Git add and commit the file with message: `agent_runner debug smoke`.
3) Make a network call: `curl -fsSL https://example.com >/dev/null`.
4) Respond with a short summary of what you did.

**Planning smoke test command sequence**
codex
I’ll run the requested smoke sequence directly in the repo: create the file, commit it, then execute the `curl` network check, and report the result.
exec
/bin/bash -lc "set -euo pipefail
mkdir -p tmp/agent_runner_debug
printf 'smoke ok\\n' > tmp/agent_runner_debug/smoke.txt
git add tmp/agent_runner_debug/smoke.txt
git commit -m 'agent_runner debug smoke'
curl -fsSL https://example.com >/dev/null
git rev-parse --short HEAD" in /home/dzack/lattice_interface exited 1 in 51ms:
The following paths are ignored by one of your .gitignore files:
tmp/agent_runner_debug
hint: Use -f if you really want to add them.
hint: Turn this message off by running
hint: "git config advice.addIgnoredFile false"

thinking
**Handling ignored paths with force add and commit**
codex
`tmp/` is gitignored here, so I’m re-running with a forced add for that file and then completing commit plus network check.
exec
/bin/bash -lc "set -euo pipefail
git add -f tmp/agent_runner_debug/smoke.txt
git commit -m 'agent_runner debug smoke'
curl -fsSL https://example.com >/dev/null
git rev-parse --short HEAD" in /home/dzack/lattice_interface exited 6 in 51ms:
[main 0a53153] agent_runner debug smoke
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+), 1 deletion(-)
curl: (6) Could not resolve host: example.com

thinking
**Retrying network request despite failure**
codex
The commit succeeded; I’m retrying the `curl` once to confirm whether the network failure is persistent or transient.
exec
/bin/bash -lc 'curl -fsSL https://example.com >/dev/null' in /home/dzack/lattice_interface exited 6 in 50ms:
curl: (6) Could not resolve host: example.com
