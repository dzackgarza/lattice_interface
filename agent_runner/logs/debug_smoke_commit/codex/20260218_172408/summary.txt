last_message: Completed the smoke steps with one constraint:

1. Wrote `tmp/agent_runner_debug/smoke.txt` with `smoke ok`.
2. Added and committed it as `agent_runner debug smoke` (commit `0a53153`).
3. Ran `curl -fsSL https://example.com >/dev/null` (retried once), but it failed both times with `Could not resolve host: example.com` (DNS/network unavailable in this environment).
