Completed the smoke test steps with one repo-specific adjustment:

1. Created `tmp/agent_runner_debug/smoke.txt` with:
   - `smoke ok`
2. Staged and committed it as `agent_runner debug smoke`:
   - Commit: `708bae2`
   - Note: `tmp/` is gitignored, so I used `git add -f tmp/agent_runner_debug/smoke.txt`.
3. Ran the network command exactly:
   - `curl -fsSL https://example.com >/dev/null`
   - Result: failed with `curl: (6) Could not resolve host: example.com` (DNS/network unavailable in this environment).
