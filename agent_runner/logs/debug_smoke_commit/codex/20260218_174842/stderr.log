# Debug Commit + Network Smoke Test

You are running in a repo. Do the minimum steps to prove you can write, commit, and access the network.

Steps:
1) Create a new file at `tmp/agent_runner_debug/smoke.txt` with a single line: `smoke ok`.
2) Git add and commit the file with message: `agent_runner debug smoke`.
3) Make a network call: `curl -fsSL https://example.com >/dev/null`.
4) Respond with a short summary of what you did.

I’m going to run the four smoke-test steps exactly as requested: create the file, commit it, run the `curl` network check, then report the result. I’ll execute them now and share the outcome.

**Choosing command execution method**
exec
/bin/bash -lc "set -euo pipefail
mkdir -p tmp/agent_runner_debug
printf 'smoke ok
' > tmp/agent_runner_debug/smoke.txt
cat tmp/agent_runner_debug/smoke.txt" in /home/dzack/lattice_interface succeeded in 51ms:
smoke ok
codex
File creation is complete and contains the expected single line. Next I’m staging and committing it with the exact commit message you specified.

thinking
**Committing code changes**
exec
/bin/bash -lc "set -euo pipefail
git add tmp/agent_runner_debug/smoke.txt
git commit -m 'agent_runner debug smoke'" in /home/dzack/lattice_interface exited 1 in 51ms:
The following paths are ignored by one of your .gitignore files:
tmp/agent_runner_debug
hint: Use -f if you really want to add them.
hint: Turn this message off by running
hint: "git config advice.addIgnoredFile false"

thinking
**Forcing add to commit ignored files**
codex
`tmp/` is gitignored in this repo, so normal `git add` was rejected. I’m force-adding that one file and retrying the commit so the smoke test can complete.

thinking
**Staging changes for commit**
exec
/bin/bash -lc "set -euo pipefail
git add -f tmp/agent_runner_debug/smoke.txt
git commit -m 'agent_runner debug smoke'" in /home/dzack/lattice_interface succeeded in 51ms:
[main 708bae2] agent_runner debug smoke

**Proceeding with curl request**
codex
Commit is now created successfully. I’m running the network smoke check with `curl` next.
exec
/bin/bash -lc 'curl -fsSL https://example.com >/dev/null' in /home/dzack/lattice_interface exited 6 in 51ms:
curl: (6) Could not resolve host: example.com

thinking
**Summarizing network failure outcome**
codex
Completed the smoke test steps with one repo-specific adjustment:

1. Created `tmp/agent_runner_debug/smoke.txt` with:
   - `smoke ok`
2. Staged and committed it as `agent_runner debug smoke`:
   - Commit: `708bae2`
   - Note: `tmp/` is gitignored, so I used `git add -f tmp/agent_runner_debug/smoke.txt`.
3. Ran the network command exactly:
   - `curl -fsSL https://example.com >/dev/null`
   - Result: failed with `curl: (6) Could not resolve host: example.com` (DNS/network unavailable in this environment).
