Completed steps 1–3 with one caveat on network:

- Created `tmp/agent_runner_debug/smoke.txt` containing exactly `smoke ok`.
- Staged and committed it with message `agent_runner debug smoke` (commit `48753ab`).
- Ran `curl -fsSL https://example.com >/dev/null`, which failed with `curl: (6) Could not resolve host: example.com` (DNS/network access unavailable in this environment).

# Debug Commit + Network Smoke Test

You are running in a repo. Do the minimum steps to prove you can write, commit, and access the network.

Steps:
1) Create a new file at `tmp/agent_runner_debug/smoke.txt` with a single line: `smoke ok`.
2) Git add and commit the file with message: `agent_runner debug smoke`.
3) Make a network call: `curl -fsSL https://example.com >/dev/null`.
4) Respond with a short summary of what you did.

**Planning sequential command execution**
codex
I’ll run the four steps in order: create the smoke file, commit just that file, run the `curl` smoke call, then report the results. I’m starting with file creation now.
exec
/bin/bash -lc "mkdir -p tmp/agent_runner_debug && printf 'smoke ok
' > tmp/agent_runner_debug/smoke.txt && ls -l tmp/agent_runner_debug/smoke.txt" in /home/dzack/lattice_interface succeeded in 51ms:
-rw-rw-r-- 1 dzack dzack 9 Feb 18 18:09 tmp/agent_runner_debug/smoke.txt

thinking
**Committing changes cautiously**
codex
File is in place. Next I’m staging and committing only `tmp/agent_runner_debug/smoke.txt` with the requested commit message.
exec
/bin/bash -lc "git add tmp/agent_runner_debug/smoke.txt && git commit -m 'agent_runner debug smoke'" in /home/dzack/lattice_interface exited 1 in 51ms:
The following paths are ignored by one of your .gitignore files:
tmp/agent_runner_debug
hint: Use -f if you really want to add them.
hint: Turn this message off by running
hint: "git config advice.addIgnoredFile false"

thinking
**Forcing add of gitignored files**
codex
`tmp/` is gitignored in this repo, so I’m force-adding that file and re-running the commit with the same message.
exec
/bin/bash -lc "git add -f tmp/agent_runner_debug/smoke.txt && git commit -m 'agent_runner debug smoke'" in /home/dzack/lattice_interface succeeded in 51ms:
[main 48753ab] agent_runner debug smoke
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+), 1 deletion(-)

thinking
**Confirming file tracking and next step**
codex
Commit succeeded. I’m running the network smoke command exactly as requested.
exec
/bin/bash -lc 'curl -fsSL https://example.com >/dev/null' in /home/dzack/lattice_interface exited 6 in 50ms:
curl: (6) Could not resolve host: example.com
