last_message: Completed steps 1–3 with one caveat on network:

- Created `tmp/agent_runner_debug/smoke.txt` containing exactly `smoke ok`.
- Staged and committed it with message `agent_runner debug smoke` (commit `48753ab`).
- Ran `curl -fsSL https://example.com >/dev/null`, which failed with `curl: (6) Could not resolve host: example.com` (DNS/network access unavailable in this environment).
